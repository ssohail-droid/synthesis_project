    <h2>Message</h2>
    <p>In <em>The Book Thief</em>, Markus Zusak illustrates how literacy and storytelling become a means of survival, emotional resilience, and human connection during times of political unrest and personal trauma. Liesel’s ability to read and write not only empowers her, but also becomes a symbol of resistance against the dehumanizing effects of Nazi ideology.</p>
